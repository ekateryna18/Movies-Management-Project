C++ app for managing movies using Qt for UI.
The movies are loaded and saved from and to a .txt file.
This app lets you add, delete, modify, sort and filter movies.
You can also create a cart, where you can add or delete a desired movie, or generate a number of movies into it.
Just for fun, there is a spare window that will show as many cats as the number of movies in the cart :)
Enjoy ^.^
